        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Lab1</h2>
        <p>Our first lab was easy until I submitted it LOL!
            In the first lab I learned how easy 1 mistake can alter the entire document.I've never coded anything before so this was my first time ever doing this</p>
            <h3>Lab2</h3>
            <p>The second lab was a little difficult for me because I'm sick and can't focus on the reading that came with it and I keep falling asleep because of the cold medicine I'm taking. However I did learn the many elements that come with structuring an HTML document.The link validator that we use helped me figure out a few mistakes I made but overall for this to be my second time coding something it was not too difficult. I can't wait to see how hard our other labs will be.</p>
            <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
            <ol>
            <li> Indents matter</li>
            <li>Check github link before submitting</li>
            <li>Using the preview feature in VS code helps alot!</li>
            </ol>
